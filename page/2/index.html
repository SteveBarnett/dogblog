					<p>Roxy is still awesome!<br />
In case there was any doubt.<br />
She&#8217;s a bit older, a bit calmer, better at being taken to people&#8217;s houses.</p>
<p>The relationship between here and the cats continues to improve, especially with Meep. They often up end sleeping in the same bit of the house and don&#8217;t bother each other. Sproing is more&#8230; complicated.</p>
<p>We wanted to go back and go the next level of puppy class, but the class was cancelled because not enough people were interested :(.<br />
The location and time and all that were perfect, so hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to catch the next wave.</p>
<p>Morning dog park jaunts are as fun as ever. Cool people, cool dogs, lovely way to start the day.</p>
<p>Have some pictures of Roxy from last weekend, on Kommetjie beach.<br />

					<p>Helloes.</p>
<p>Despite my lack of blogifying here, Roxy has continued to grow!<br />
She&#8217;s five months old now, so mostly fully grown.<br />
Squeak!<br />
Busy times recently with visitors from overseas and work being mentalcrazybusy.</p>
<h3>Class of Puppies</h3>
<p>We graduated from the puppy class (got a certificate and everything. It lives on the fridge. Can&#8217;t wait until she starts bringing drawings home from school!*) and will definitely be joining an intermediate class in the new year. Lots of people are on holidays and things over December, so running classes go a bit quiet because of likely low attendance.</p>
<p>Not sure yet if we&#8217;ll go back to the same place. The beginner class was good, and the location and time (Newlands, Saturday afternoon) are very convenient. I think my only bad comment about the classes is that there was a little too much downtime / playtime compared to learning stuff time. I think I would have preferred more, shorter, breaks and more focused learning bits. But, perhaps that&#8217;s more appropriate for the next class &#8211; we shall see! It was great for socialisation and doing &#8220;tricks&#8221; in &#8220;challenging&#8221; &#8220;situations.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Dog Park</h3>
<p>We have a fairly regular morning routine now: off to The Dog Park after coffee (and training (which continues, btw, at breakfast and dinner)) for some running around and playing with other doggies.<br />
There&#8217;s a pretty solid group that we see every day or so &#8211; one dog and his owner in particular seem to match our timeslot well: Rose and her dog Jack.<br />
Jack is very similar in look and heritage (i.e. mushed) to Roxy, and they get on very well and run around like two mad things being mad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a water spot in The Dog Park (that looks like a municipality water access point) that has a tap in so that folk can fill it up.<br />
Roxy has learned from two Jack Russells that we often see in the park the tricks of: 1 &#8211; spitting the ball into the pool; 2 &#8211; diving into it head (and legs) first.</p>
<p>Exhibits A and B below: evidence and aftermath. [Click to MoreBigIfy]<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/10.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/10-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="10" width="224" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-225" /></a><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/21.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/21-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="21" width="224" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-226" /></a></p>
<h3>&#8220;Cute!&#8221;</h3>
<p>Roxy is still making us even more walky than we were before. I like naytcha.<br />
Most Saturday mornings we go off to Newlands for walkies, sometimes off to further afield.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very pleasing that we still get lots of people saying nice things about Roxy: how pretty and good-natured she is.<br />
I like to think that at least some of this is due to us :).</p>
<h3>Tricksy, Precious</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re about to dig out the books and start looking for new stuff to teach her, but latest greatest hits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump (straight up in the air, not onto a human)</li>
<li>Bark (very exciting, apparently)</li>
<li>Hop (on to tree stumps and rocks when out and about. She may have a complex about being short ;] )</li>
<li>Fetch (loves it. Runs like a mad thing)</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Comments</h3>
<p>*salute*<br />
She&#8217;s still pretty well behaved.<br />
House training seems to have caught on and stuck, even when&#8217;s left in the bedroom and not inside her kennel. Next step for later is to let her have the whole house. For now, for our stuff&#8217;s safety and the cats&#8217; sanity, she stay in our room.<br />
She comes when called, even when in the park or the forest.<br />
She does respond to commands from other people, even&#8230; children.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s still a little bit of a handful in some social situations.<br />
She&#8217;s still young, so she&#8217;s a bit unpredictable.<br />
Went to a braai out at Hendrick&#8217;s the other day, and Roxy decided that barking at kids was Where It&#8217;s At.<br />
Cue much throwing of ball as distraction.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.<br />
Be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>______________________________</p>

					<p>So, Roxy seemed to love Shekinah Lodge.<br />
She came home very tired*, a bit scratched**, and very happy.<br />
It took her a minute to come out of the Wendy house and say hello because she was so deep asleep!</p>
<p>She seems to have remembered all the basic level training from &#8220;before,&#8221; but is struggling a bit with the compound command stuff. And this morning she was just mental. &#8220;Run! I wish to Run!&#8221;</p>
<p>We have finally caved in to her demands and have got her a cellphone.<br />
At least now we can check on her via SMS whenever we want.<br />
What? We&#8217;re not mad.<br />
It&#8217;s only a Pay As You Go!<br />
Pffft!***</p>
<p>Roxy is now sleeping through night, mostly.<br />
The problem is that rest of The Zoo sets her off.<br />
Sproing likes to &#8220;Start Some Shit&#8221; or &#8220;Set It Off&#8221; an hour or half an hour before actual waking up time, and tis wakes up Roxy.<br />
She tends to settle down and go back to sleep after a quick trip outside, though.</p>
<p>House training seems to be pretty much sorted. This is partially because we don&#8217;t give her the chance to get it wrong.<br />
When we started getting all these free papers over the wall a while ago, we were happy because we needed them. Now they&#8217;re just mounting up in the cupboard because we&#8217;re not using them.<br />
My spies tell me that some people <em>read</em> newspapers.<br />
I am intrigued by this.</p>
<p>_____<br />
* &#8211; two days. She<br />
basically just slept for two days after she came back. I think she was playing all day long while she was there.<br />
** &#8211; a few minor cuts and scrapes that you&#8217;d expect from all day rough and tumble on a farm with a bunch of other dogs. I don&#8217;t think <em>she</em> even noticed!<br />
***- yes, this paragraph was a &#8220;joke.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Radish!<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-074323.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-074323-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="20101012-074323.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" /></a><br />
We left the &#8216;dish in the ground a little too long and it looked a bit too mutant to eat.<br />
So we gave it to the dog! <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>Puppy Class on Saturday went very well.<br />
Roxy performed well, we were proud!<br />
The big trick for the week was Leave It, which, as avid readers will know, she likes a lot.</p>
<p>We also did &#8220;Puppy Pushups&#8221; &#8211; sit, down, sit.<br />
We do do this at home already, so again the test was just about the new place and doggy distractions.</p>
<h3>Chipping</h3>
<p>Ran off to the Vet last night and Roxy got more shots, plus a chip of the micro variety.<br />
Now we can find out where she is at weekends if she doesn&#8217;t answer her cellphone.<br />

<h3>Farm Kennel Thing</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re off on Thursday morning for a few days.<br />
We have a house-sitter coming in (Thank you, Lesley!), but we didn&#8217;t want to impose dog-sitting.<br />
So, we looked for, and found, a kennel type place.<br />
The place, Shekinah Lodge, is lovely. It&#8217;s a farm plot, divided up into little fields.<br />
They put their pups into packs of similar sizes and temperaments, and they run around in their fieldy bits.<br />
Each fieldy bit also has a paddling pool and a big (air-conditioned / heated in summer / winter) wendy house for sleeping.<br />
It&#8217;s lush, man!<br />
We will be sad to leave Roxy there, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll have lots of fun and the other dogs there looked silly-happy.</p>
<p>We had a bit of a practice on Sunday, actually.<br />
We were out for the day and Anna kindly agreed (thank you!) to let Roxy bounce around with Moneo, her border collie, for the day.<br />
Roxy was apparently fine for a few hours, then had a bit of a cry, then was fine again.<br />
<img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> + (;_;) + <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
We took her there at 9 in the morning and picked her up at 5 in the evening, and she was shattered. I think she didn&#8217;t stopped playing the whole day.<br />
This bodes well for the kennelling: she will be too tired to miss us!</p>
