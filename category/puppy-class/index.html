					<p>Roxy is still awesome!<br />
In case there was any doubt.<br />
She&#8217;s a bit older, a bit calmer, better at being taken to people&#8217;s houses.</p>
<p>The relationship between here and the cats continues to improve, especially with Meep. They often up end sleeping in the same bit of the house and don&#8217;t bother each other. Sproing is more&#8230; complicated.</p>
<p>We wanted to go back and go the next level of puppy class, but the class was cancelled because not enough people were interested :(.<br />
The location and time and all that were perfect, so hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to catch the next wave.</p>
<p>Morning dog park jaunts are as fun as ever. Cool people, cool dogs, lovely way to start the day.</p>
<p>Have some pictures of Roxy from last weekend, on Kommetjie beach.<br />

					<p>Helloes.</p>
<p>Despite my lack of blogifying here, Roxy has continued to grow!<br />
She&#8217;s five months old now, so mostly fully grown.<br />
Squeak!<br />
Busy times recently with visitors from overseas and work being mentalcrazybusy.</p>
<h3>Class of Puppies</h3>
<p>We graduated from the puppy class (got a certificate and everything. It lives on the fridge. Can&#8217;t wait until she starts bringing drawings home from school!*) and will definitely be joining an intermediate class in the new year. Lots of people are on holidays and things over December, so running classes go a bit quiet because of likely low attendance.</p>
<p>Not sure yet if we&#8217;ll go back to the same place. The beginner class was good, and the location and time (Newlands, Saturday afternoon) are very convenient. I think my only bad comment about the classes is that there was a little too much downtime / playtime compared to learning stuff time. I think I would have preferred more, shorter, breaks and more focused learning bits. But, perhaps that&#8217;s more appropriate for the next class &#8211; we shall see! It was great for socialisation and doing &#8220;tricks&#8221; in &#8220;challenging&#8221; &#8220;situations.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Dog Park</h3>
<p>We have a fairly regular morning routine now: off to The Dog Park after coffee (and training (which continues, btw, at breakfast and dinner)) for some running around and playing with other doggies.<br />
There&#8217;s a pretty solid group that we see every day or so &#8211; one dog and his owner in particular seem to match our timeslot well: Rose and her dog Jack.<br />
Jack is very similar in look and heritage (i.e. mushed) to Roxy, and they get on very well and run around like two mad things being mad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a water spot in The Dog Park (that looks like a municipality water access point) that has a tap in so that folk can fill it up.<br />
Roxy has learned from two Jack Russells that we often see in the park the tricks of: 1 &#8211; spitting the ball into the pool; 2 &#8211; diving into it head (and legs) first.</p>
<p>Exhibits A and B below: evidence and aftermath. [Click to MoreBigIfy]<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/10.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/10-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="10" width="224" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-225" /></a><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/21.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/12/21-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="21" width="224" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-226" /></a></p>
<h3>&#8220;Cute!&#8221;</h3>
<p>Roxy is still making us even more walky than we were before. I like naytcha.<br />
Most Saturday mornings we go off to Newlands for walkies, sometimes off to further afield.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very pleasing that we still get lots of people saying nice things about Roxy: how pretty and good-natured she is.<br />
I like to think that at least some of this is due to us :).</p>
<h3>Tricksy, Precious</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re about to dig out the books and start looking for new stuff to teach her, but latest greatest hits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump (straight up in the air, not onto a human)</li>
<li>Bark (very exciting, apparently)</li>
<li>Hop (on to tree stumps and rocks when out and about. She may have a complex about being short ;] )</li>
<li>Fetch (loves it. Runs like a mad thing)</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Comments</h3>
<p>*salute*<br />
She&#8217;s still pretty well behaved.<br />
House training seems to have caught on and stuck, even when&#8217;s left in the bedroom and not inside her kennel. Next step for later is to let her have the whole house. For now, for our stuff&#8217;s safety and the cats&#8217; sanity, she stay in our room.<br />
She comes when called, even when in the park or the forest.<br />
She does respond to commands from other people, even&#8230; children.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s still a little bit of a handful in some social situations.<br />
She&#8217;s still young, so she&#8217;s a bit unpredictable.<br />
Went to a braai out at Hendrick&#8217;s the other day, and Roxy decided that barking at kids was Where It&#8217;s At.<br />
Cue much throwing of ball as distraction.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.<br />
Be excellent to each other.</p>
<p>______________________________</p>
<p>* &#8211; This is a joke.</p>

					<p>Radish!<br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-074323.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-074323-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="20101012-074323.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" /></a><br />
We left the &#8216;dish in the ground a little too long and it looked a bit too mutant to eat.<br />
So we gave it to the dog! <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>Puppy Class on Saturday went very well.<br />
Roxy performed well, we were proud!<br />
The big trick for the week was Leave It, which, as avid readers will know, she likes a lot.</p>
<p>We also did &#8220;Puppy Pushups&#8221; &#8211; sit, down, sit.<br />
We do do this at home already, so again the test was just about the new place and doggy distractions.</p>
<h3>Chipping</h3>
<p>Ran off to the Vet last night and Roxy got more shots, plus a chip of the micro variety.<br />
Now we can find out where she is at weekends if she doesn&#8217;t answer her cellphone.<br />
<img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Farm Kennel Thing</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re off on Thursday morning for a few days.<br />
We have a house-sitter coming in (Thank you, Lesley!), but we didn&#8217;t want to impose dog-sitting.<br />
So, we looked for, and found, a kennel type place.<br />
The place, Shekinah Lodge, is lovely. It&#8217;s a farm plot, divided up into little fields.<br />
They put their pups into packs of similar sizes and temperaments, and they run around in their fieldy bits.<br />
Each fieldy bit also has a paddling pool and a big (air-conditioned / heated in summer / winter) wendy house for sleeping.<br />
It&#8217;s lush, man!<br />
We will be sad to leave Roxy there, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll have lots of fun and the other dogs there looked silly-happy.</p>
<p>We had a bit of a practice on Sunday, actually.<br />
We were out for the day and Anna kindly agreed (thank you!) to let Roxy bounce around with Moneo, her border collie, for the day.<br />
Roxy was apparently fine for a few hours, then had a bit of a cry, then was fine again.<br />
<img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> + (;_;) + <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
We took her there at 9 in the morning and picked her up at 5 in the evening, and she was shattered. I think she didn&#8217;t stopped playing the whole day.<br />
This bodes well for the kennelling: she will be too tired to miss us!</p>

					<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>Puppy Class last week went much better.<br />
For the humans <strong>and</strong> Roxy!<br />
She still went crazy-play-time with the other dogs (especially a little Miniature Terrier called Knoffel, who Jo snapped a pic of &#8211; must remember to grab it. They is bestest fwiends), but she did much better in terms of concentration for the training stuff.<br />
It was kewl!<br />
Proud puppy parents, we were :).</p>
<h3>Compound Commands</h3>
<p>By which I mean: Stay, do some stuff, Unstay.<br />
And: Leave it, do some stuff, Unleaveit.<br />
Not so easy! But she&#8217;s getting good at it.</p>
<p>Leave it is still her favourite game.<br />
Favourite variation: Leave It, Down (tentatively), Come (excitedly), OK.</p>
<p>Aside: some of the books recommend praising a good obey with Good + Name of Command.<br />
&#8220;Good Come&#8221; will <em>never</em> get old :).</p>
<h3>TRL #5</h3>
<p>Her bed.<br />
And destroying it.<br />
As of a few minutes ago, there is just a mess of material where once there was a comfy bed.<br />
She hasn&#8217;t (touch wood!) chowed up anything else, though. At all. Is odd.</p>

					<p>On Saturday we did another lovely walk in Newlands forest.<br />
And we unleashed Teh Roxxel! I mean deleashed. I mean took the leash off.<br />
She was very well behaved! So much so that we think she didn&#8217;t realise that the leash was off.<br />
No running away to investigate interesting smells, or that kind of thing. She stuck by us strolling.<br />
It was pleasing! <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>The only, ahem, slight problem was that it went on a bit longer than we planned.<br />
About an hour instead of about half an hour.<br />
This is a little bit a function of our style of Newlands walking (which is: no plan. Just meander).<br />
She was falling asleep in the car on the way home.<br />
Normally this is great, but in an hour or so&#8217;s time was&#8230;</p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve opted, for now, for a class in Newlands.<br />
The one we really wanted to go to is <a href="http://www.tarynblyth.co.za/">Taryn Blyth</a>&#8216;s (she sounds great and has the kind of approach that we concur with), but she&#8217;s out in Kommetjie, and so it&#8217;s not really practical.</p>
<p>Roxy barely woke up for the trip there, but found a new source of energy once we arrived and especially once the other puppies did. (0_0)!<br />
She was a little bit mental for most of the class, and didn&#8217;t do so well on obeying commands and things. She was very excited by all the other dogs.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ve identified more specifically what the problem is. Whenever we take her to see other dogs it&#8217;s playtime. We let the dogs run around while the humans chat. We need to get RoxBox used to the idea that presence of other dogs doesn&#8217;t always equal playtime.<br />
This will be difficult!</p>
<p>The other pups and owners are lovely, and the class leader lady is very nice. I found the class a little frustrating, but this is partially my fault at not speaking up.<br />
The class is teaching things like sit, stay, etc. from scratch, but we&#8217;ve been doing these at home. (A lot! Her breakfast and dinner kibbles are served as rewards for obeying commands. Roxy has the commands down pat inside, away from distraction. She&#8217;s still learning to do these things on walks (pretty good) and in the garden (not so good).)<br />
It seemed that the other owners&#8217; problems were teaching their dog what sit means, whereas ours is teaching Roxy that she must still sit when we say it, even if other dogs are about!</p>
<p>It could very well be the case that the other owners are in the same position as us, and not speaking up for fear of sounding odd / arrogant / boastful. I&#8217;m going to be more pro-active next time and talk to the the teacher about this. How do we get Roxy to chill out a bit and obey when there are lots of other doggies around.</p>
