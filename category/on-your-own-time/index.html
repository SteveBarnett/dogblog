<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-074323.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101012-074323-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="20101012-074323.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" /></a><br />
We left the &#8216;dish in the ground a little too long and it looked a bit too mutant to eat.<br />
So we gave it to the dog! <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>Puppy Class on Saturday went very well.<br />
Roxy performed well, we were proud!<br />
The big trick for the week was Leave It, which, as avid readers will know, she likes a lot.</p>
<p>We also did &#8220;Puppy Pushups&#8221; &#8211; sit, down, sit.<br />
We do do this at home already, so again the test was just about the new place and doggy distractions.</p>
<h3>Chipping</h3>
<p>Ran off to the Vet last night and Roxy got more shots, plus a chip of the micro variety.<br />
Now we can find out where she is at weekends if she doesn&#8217;t answer her cellphone.<br />
<img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Farm Kennel Thing</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re off on Thursday morning for a few days.<br />
We have a house-sitter coming in (Thank you, Lesley!), but we didn&#8217;t want to impose dog-sitting.<br />
So, we looked for, and found, a kennel type place.<br />
The place, Shekinah Lodge, is lovely. It&#8217;s a farm plot, divided up into little fields.<br />
They put their pups into packs of similar sizes and temperaments, and they run around in their fieldy bits.<br />
Each fieldy bit also has a paddling pool and a big (air-conditioned / heated in summer / winter) wendy house for sleeping.<br />
It&#8217;s lush, man!<br />
We will be sad to leave Roxy there, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll have lots of fun and the other dogs there looked silly-happy.</p>
<p>We had a bit of a practice on Sunday, actually.<br />
We were out for the day and Anna kindly agreed (thank you!) to let Roxy bounce around with Moneo, her border collie, for the day.<br />
Roxy was apparently fine for a few hours, then had a bit of a cry, then was fine again.<br />
<img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> + (;_;) + <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
We took her there at 9 in the morning and picked her up at 5 in the evening, and she was shattered. I think she didn&#8217;t stopped playing the whole day.<br />
This bodes well for the kennelling: she will be too tired to miss us!</p>

					<p>Roxy continues to amuse and entertain and be lovely.<br />
She&#8217;s still very friendly and excited to meet people and this pleases me.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re giving her training sessions each day before each meal.<br />
In the mornings, evenings, and weekends this means me and puppy mummy.<br />
We stand at opposite ends of the study/lounge/kitchen area and take turns calling her to us for some training goodness.<br />
Like a game of dog tennis.<br />
It is awesome.<br />
At the moment we&#8217;re doing Sit, Stay, Down.<br />
Roxy is clever! The dog books / sites do not lie! Training is fun!<br />
Being a puppy daddy is happy making.</p>
<h3>Sad Face</h3>
<p>On Friday last week I had a meeting thing at 10 and another at 2.<br />
I thought I&#8217;d have at least an hour between them for some eating, weeing, and playing (for Roxy and for me).<br />
My 10 ran over bigtime, and I practically had to run in, feed her, run out. And I was still ten minutes late for the 2 meeting!<br />
I felt like a very bad puppy daddy. <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
And <strong>I</strong> had separation anxiety while I was out, never mind her!</p>
<p>An an antidote, have some pictures of Roxy acting a bit mad in the garden: <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF0596.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF0596-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0596" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-84" /></a><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF0582.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF0582-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0582" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-83" /></a><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF0568.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF0568-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0568" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-82" /></a></p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t be a pussy</h3>
<p>In other news, she appears to be learning to fight / play like  cat.<br />
She copies Sproing&#8217;s one paw punch.<br />
We saw it in action a lot yesterday when we went to visit Anna and her very well behaved, but very energetic, Border Collie &#8211; Maneo.<br />
It&#8217;s very interesting to watch Roxy&#8217;s reactions to other dogs.<br />
She spent the fist hour hiding under the couch and yelping a lot.<br />
She spent the last hour climbing over his face and biting his ears.<br />
She slept very, very, well last night!</p>

					<p>Most recent challenge: collar.<br />
We haz a very cute red one (photo below) that Roxy, of course, hates.<br />
She goes into this weird epileptic-type fit once she realises she&#8217;s got it on, then flumps down somewhere and looks all depressed. Poor puppy!</p>
<p>We have adapted the kennel.<br />
She&#8217;s an inside dog, so kennelling outside seems silly.<br />
The kennel currently lives, roofless, next to the bed, with her dog bed in it.<br />
She loves it!<br />
After the next week or two, we&#8217;re going to put the roof back on and move the kennel into a corner.<br />
Slowly, slowly, catch-y soft monkey. Dog. Thing.<br />
After that, it gets a door on the front. It&#8217;s all about <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=dog+crating">crating</a>.<br />
It seemed a bit mental to me at first, but now I&#8217;m getting the idea. Safe, quiet, place and all that.</p>
<p>Finally managing to find some time to read the dog training book we bought.<br />
It&#8217;s got some good training techniques, but lots of it is wrapped in odd hippy new-age stuff.<br />
Hmm.</p>
<p>Also: photos!<br />

					<p>Roxy favourite thing to do (when she&#8217;s excited) is to bite stuff.<br />
Like our toes. Mine are especially easy targets because I&#8217;m wearing slops more often that not.<br />
The <strong>distraction</strong> technique is partially working.<br />
The <strong>yelp</strong> technique seems to be having a better effect. This is the rather embarrassing act of basically imitating a puppy playmate; if Roxy bites too hard, you yelp like you&#8217;ve been hurt (not too difficult &#8211; her teeth are pretty sharp.).<br />
Next step is combining this with downtime. The trick (apparently, like most of the training) is not too make the punishment too shouty / angry. Going to the chill out room (classical music playing almost 24-7. Yo.) isn&#8217;t the punishment (because the chill out room is gooood and *hypno-face* you waaaaant to gooooo there) &#8211; being alone is the punishment. If you are good, you get to spend time with the humans.<br />
Well, something like that.</p>
<p>Going back to the <a href="../../2010/08/some-special-on-your-own-time/index.html#comment-5">SOHO</a> for a minute: I don&#8217;t have any problems with being a hard ass. Umm&#8230;<br />
I <em>will not</em> go and comfort / say hi to Roxy while she&#8217;s still whining and whinging (and fecking A, she can whine and whinge. The sounds are so weird. I will attempt to describe them later.) when she&#8217;s on her own in the bedroom (and supposed to be sleeping / chilling).<br />
I know that this is good for Roxy (and us) in terms of obedience and a good relationship and all that. But man, it frazzles your head. (0_o)</p>

					<p>This is a bit out of sequence, but: current big task is to get Roxy used to being on her own.<br />
Since I work from home she&#8217;ll be spending a lot of time around me. This is groovy.<br />
However, I do need to leave the house during the day occasionally (to buy chocolate or go and drink beer with <a href="http://evollusion.co.za/">Evo</a>, for example).<br />
Also, Jo and I are quite social creatures and we like to go out and see people for dinner in the evening.<br />
So, what to do with doggy?</p>
<p>We tried some kennel action yesterday. I had to go out for about two hours to a meeting.<br />
We spent time with her, getting her used to the kennel, gave her a whole bunch of her toys and stuff, but the experiment was basically a failure.<br />
She managed to get out of the enclosure we&#8217;d built on the stoop around the kennel and was barking / yowling at the bedroom window.<br />
I suspect the cats (i.e. Sproing) took the opportunity to be less than friendly with her. Fear The Claw.</p>
<p>So, new plan, after more researching: leave her in the house, in a closed off area.<br />
She sleeps in a dog bed next to our bed. For now, we close this off so that she only has access to a bit of the bedroom &#8211; the bit with newspaper on the floor.<br />
The plan is to put her there while we&#8217;re out, to tire her out by lots of playing before we leave, and to leave her with her toys and a stuffed <a href="http://www.kongcompany.com/">Kong</a> thingy (which, btw, are silly good.).<br />
Second prong of plan is to put her there during the daytime to get used to being away from Teh Humans.<br />
Which is where she is right now.<br />
Sleeping.</p>
<p>In other news: I am sleepy and am having great trouble concentrating on work.<br />
As you may be able to tell&#8230;</p>
