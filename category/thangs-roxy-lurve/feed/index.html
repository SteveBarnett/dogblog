				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>Puppy Class last week went much better.<br />
For the humans <strong>and</strong> Roxy!<br />
She still went crazy-play-time with the other dogs (especially a little Miniature Terrier called Knoffel, who Jo snapped a pic of &#8211; must remember to grab it. They is bestest fwiends), but she did much better in terms of concentration for the training stuff.<br />
It was kewl!<br />
Proud puppy parents, we were :).</p>
<h3>Compound Commands</h3>
<p>By which I mean: Stay, do some stuff, Unstay.<br />
And: Leave it, do some stuff, Unleaveit.<br />
Not so easy! But she&#8217;s getting good at it.</p>
<p>Leave it is still her favourite game.<br />
Favourite variation: Leave It, Down (tentatively), Come (excitedly), OK.</p>
<p>Aside: some of the books recommend praising a good obey with Good + Name of Command.<br />
&#8220;Good Come&#8221; will <em>never</em> get old :).</p>
<h3>TRL #5</h3>
<p>Her bed.<br />
And destroying it.<br />
As of a few minutes ago, there is just a mess of material where once there was a comfy bed.<br />
She hasn&#8217;t (touch wood!) chowed up anything else, though. At all. Is odd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re doing pretty regular walkies in Newlands now.<br />
Catch us LIVE early Saturday mornings!<br />
Ahem.<br />
Here&#8217;s a pic of Roxy being unsure of forest stream stuff:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3089.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3089-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3089" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-164" /></a></p>
<p>Apologies for the general recent lack of photos.<br />
She&#8217;s pretty active, and here are representative samples of what lots of the pictures on camera look like:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3092.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3092-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3092" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-165" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3094.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3094-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3094" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-166" /></a><br />
<img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Touch of Class</h3>
<p>Puppy class was cancelled yesterday since most people are off on holiday for the long weekend.<br />
We are okay with that.<br />
Ahem.</p>
<h3>TRL #4</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a new treat was tried: a boiled egg.<br />
She lurved it.<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3139.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3139-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3139" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-167" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3144.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3144-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3144" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-168" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3154.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3154-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3154" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-169" /></a></p>
<h3>Ear Watch</h3>
<p>Still some good oneuponedownmanship:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3169.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3169-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3169" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-170" /></a><br />
There&#8217;s a slight general leaning to left on both, like she&#8217;s standing in front a wind turbine.</p>
<h3>It moves in mysterious ways</h3>
<p>Up until now, the kennel had been next to the bed.<br />
As a sort of security blanket kind of thing.<br />
Yesterday we moved it into the corner of the room and threw in some treats (biltong and stuff) to ease the transition.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure she noticed.<br />
<img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Leave It</h3>
<p>One &#8220;trick&#8221; that she&#8217;s pretty good at it is <strong>Leave It</strong>.<br />
Immediately after she learnt it, and we started putting it on the ground, she would jump back a little. Like she had to back up a bit so she wouldn&#8217;t be tempted.<br />
Now she stays still, and we can walk around the house, and she&#8217;ll leave it.</p>
<p>The reason I mention it is because we&#8217;re being sneaky and using it to help other stuff.<br />
She doesn&#8217;t like eating from her bowl.<br />
Every morning and evening we train her with her food, and when she seems to have reached her limit for the day, we put the rest in the bowl.<br />
She would look at it slightly confused / disturbed, and trot off. If we put it on the floor, next to the bowl, she would hoover it up.<br />
So, new plan, working so far, is to put the bowl down and tell her to Leave It. Then when you release her with &#8220;OK&#8221; she trots up to the bowl and commences noshing.<br />
Huzzah!</p>

And a forest where people like to walk their doggies a lot.<br />
Now including us!<br />

All the people and most of the dogs like Roxy lotsly. Yay!<br />
She also had a trip to Starke Ayres garden centre where she was adored by all. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
<small>I will make a terrible, boastful, human-parent&#8230;</small></p>
<h3>TRL #2: Teh Ball</h3>
<p><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0752.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0752-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0752" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-142" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0750.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0750-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0750" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-141" /></a></p>
<h3>Weight watch</h3>
<p>She has slightly more than doubled in size since we got her.<br />
Crikey!</p>
<h3>&#8220;Oh, behave!&#8221;</h3>
<p>The terrible twos, as they call it for humans, are on us.<br />
She&#8217;s starting to be naughty and misbehave a bit.<br />
On the other hand, we took her to House of Lawful Good &#038; Evil last night for our traditional Sunday shenanigans, and Jo and I did a full training session with her in the house. Yay!<br />
And, once we got her an old towel to sleep on, she collapsed asleep for a few hours. Yay!</p>
<h3>In other news&#8230;</h3>
<p>She has an awesome new collar:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0758.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0758-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0758" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-143" /></a><br />
Just in time for Talk Like A Pirate Day!</p>
<h3>Canine / Feline relations section</h3>
<p>Fair, but must try harder.<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0746.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0746-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0746" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-140" /></a><br />
Both cats are standing up to Roxy more (which good because she&#8217;s about to outsize them). The don&#8217;t run way much &#8211; they sit and stare and punch as necessary.</p>
<h3>Sleeping</h3>
<p>Um, not so good. For me. Quite tired.<br />
At the moment we&#8217;re getting up in the middle of the night, then again at about 6.<br />
Roxy&#8217;s quite good at crawling back into her bed, though. We get up at 6.30, but she&#8217;s happy to snooze that little section between 6ish and 6.30(ish!).</p>
<h3>Last but not least: picture rush!</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our big challenges / missions at the moment are crate training (going quite well! She only whines for a little while, then settles down very comfortably.), leash training (also going quite well. She doesn&#8217;t mind the leash. She does enjoy walkies. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), and outside training (Umm&#8230; She&#8217;s very well behaved inside, but the outside is very, very, exciting. She gets distracted. So each day we&#8217;re doing some inside training, then some deck training, working up to garden training).</p>
<p>We went for a walk in Newlands Forest today. Without Roxy, alas &#8211; final injections due next week. Dog walking there is going to be awesome! We already enjoy walking there, but going with a doggy (like just about everyone else there) will be extra awesome.</p>
<h3>Pictures!</h3>
<p>Re-appropriation of the cat toy know as The Fillet (apologies for Flash, it was very dark):<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0686.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0686-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0686" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120" /></a></p>

<p>Thangs Roxy Lurve #2: Rose Beetles (she loves them, yeah, yeah, yeah).<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0703.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0703-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0703" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125" /></a></p>
<p>Roxy posing while Meep shows her disapproval by frying in the sun:<br />

<p>And last, but by no means least: the perfect object. No other objects need ever be made again. A rubber chicken (that squawks on squeezing) in a pirate costume (including eyepatch and wooden leg!). ZOMGBBQ! Ahem.<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0713.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0713-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0713" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-127" /></a><br />
We found it at the Milnerton Flea Market yesterday. Award yourself five bonus points if you guessed that.</p>
