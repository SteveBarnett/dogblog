<p>Puppy Class last week went much better.<br />
For the humans <strong>and</strong> Roxy!<br />
She still went crazy-play-time with the other dogs (especially a little Miniature Terrier called Knoffel, who Jo snapped a pic of &#8211; must remember to grab it. They is bestest fwiends), but she did much better in terms of concentration for the training stuff.<br />
It was kewl!<br />
Proud puppy parents, we were :).</p>
<h3>Compound Commands</h3>
<p>By which I mean: Stay, do some stuff, Unstay.<br />
And: Leave it, do some stuff, Unleaveit.<br />
Not so easy! But she&#8217;s getting good at it.</p>
<p>Leave it is still her favourite game.<br />
Favourite variation: Leave It, Down (tentatively), Come (excitedly), OK.</p>
<p>Aside: some of the books recommend praising a good obey with Good + Name of Command.<br />
&#8220;Good Come&#8221; will <em>never</em> get old :).</p>
<h3>TRL #5</h3>
<p>Her bed.<br />
And destroying it.<br />
As of a few minutes ago, there is just a mess of material where once there was a comfy bed.<br />
She hasn&#8217;t (touch wood!) chowed up anything else, though. At all. Is odd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday we did another lovely walk in Newlands forest.<br />
And we unleashed Teh Roxxel! I mean deleashed. I mean took the leash off.<br />
She was very well behaved! So much so that we think she didn&#8217;t realise that the leash was off.<br />
No running away to investigate interesting smells, or that kind of thing. She stuck by us strolling.<br />
It was pleasing! <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>The only, ahem, slight problem was that it went on a bit longer than we planned.<br />
About an hour instead of about half an hour.<br />
This is a little bit a function of our style of Newlands walking (which is: no plan. Just meander).<br />
She was falling asleep in the car on the way home.<br />
Normally this is great, but in an hour or so&#8217;s time was&#8230;</p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve opted, for now, for a class in Newlands.<br />
The one we really wanted to go to is <a href="http://www.tarynblyth.co.za/">Taryn Blyth</a>&#8216;s (she sounds great and has the kind of approach that we concur with), but she&#8217;s out in Kommetjie, and so it&#8217;s not really practical.</p>
<p>Roxy barely woke up for the trip there, but found a new source of energy once we arrived and especially once the other puppies did. (0_0)!<br />
She was a little bit mental for most of the class, and didn&#8217;t do so well on obeying commands and things. She was very excited by all the other dogs.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ve identified more specifically what the problem is. Whenever we take her to see other dogs it&#8217;s playtime. We let the dogs run around while the humans chat. We need to get RoxBox used to the idea that presence of other dogs doesn&#8217;t always equal playtime.<br />
This will be difficult!</p>
<p>The other pups and owners are lovely, and the class leader lady is very nice. I found the class a little frustrating, but this is partially my fault at not speaking up.<br />
The class is teaching things like sit, stay, etc. from scratch, but we&#8217;ve been doing these at home. (A lot! Her breakfast and dinner kibbles are served as rewards for obeying commands. Roxy has the commands down pat inside, away from distraction. She&#8217;s still learning to do these things on walks (pretty good) and in the garden (not so good).)<br />
It seemed that the other owners&#8217; problems were teaching their dog what sit means, whereas ours is teaching Roxy that she must still sit when we say it, even if other dogs are about!</p>
<p>It could very well be the case that the other owners are in the same position as us, and not speaking up for fear of sounding odd / arrogant / boastful. I&#8217;m going to be more pro-active next time and talk to the the teacher about this. How do we get Roxy to chill out a bit and obey when there are lots of other doggies around.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New favourite toy: ice cube (the solid water, not the rapper)!<br />
It slides!<br />
It wets!<br />
It&#8230; um&#8230; is lickable!</p>
<p>In other news: training is progressing at a leisurely pace.<br />
She&#8217;s a bit too young for proper book learning, ayup, but she&#8217;s sitting and coming and sometimes staying, so us puppy parents are proper proud of our pstudent.</p>
<p>At the moment, she&#8217;s all depressed and is hiding in her kennel*. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
This is because today is Collar Day.<br />
As in: it goes on and it stays on.</p>
<p>______________________________</p>
<p>* &#8211; the kennel has now been roofed. Yes, it is still inside. Yes, it is still next to the bed. No, it will not stay there forever. Yes, we are going to move it a little each day until it&#8217;s in its actual spot. Thank you for your attention. End transmission.</p>
