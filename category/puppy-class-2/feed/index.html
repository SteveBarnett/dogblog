				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve picked up puppy classes again (after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing and other potential puppy parents dropping out at the last minute) last weekend and it was very groovy.<br />
Roxy enjoys bouncing around and doing stuff, and meeting and playing with new doggies, and we enjoy teaching her new stuff and watching her learn it and get it right.<br />
We&#8217;ve hit a bit of a plateau at home: we&#8217;re not quite sure what to teach her next, so it&#8217;s nice to have the class as a motivation for new stuff.</p>
<p>There were supposed to be four dogs, but two didn&#8217;t turn up. Ahem.<br />
It was nice being in a tiny class for the day, though. More attention, doing more stuff.<br />
Next week we&#8217;re being joining by a bunch more people who&#8217;ve just finished the <strong>Introduction to Dog</strong>. According to Dog Lady, it&#8217;s mostly Labradors. Arf!</p>
<p>One interesting thing came up in chatting to the other humans: a wider world.<br />
There are two ladies who&#8217;ve moved here from Joburg, with their (with papers) Alsation.<br />
The dog is lined up for serious training with cool-sounding names like Agility and Attack.<br />
We did some quick googling about this, and it turns out there&#8217;s a whole sub-culture of this stuff: not quite the dog show people, but people doing fun stuff with their dogs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyball">flyball</a> (basically dog relay races) and hoop jumping and that kind of thing.<br />
Roxy is very light and agile and loves jumping and hopping on things, so once she&#8217;s a bit older (mostly they recommend 1 year old) we&#8217;ll definitely be taking her to something like this.<br />
Boing!</p>
