In case there was any doubt.<br />
She&#8217;s a bit older, a bit calmer, better at being taken to people&#8217;s houses.</p>
<p>The relationship between here and the cats continues to improve, especially with Meep. They often up end sleeping in the same bit of the house and don&#8217;t bother each other. Sproing is more&#8230; complicated.</p>
<p>We wanted to go back and go the next level of puppy class, but the class was cancelled because not enough people were interested :(.<br />
The location and time and all that were perfect, so hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to catch the next wave.</p>
<p>Morning dog park jaunts are as fun as ever. Cool people, cool dogs, lovely way to start the day.</p>
<p>Have some pictures of Roxy from last weekend, on Kommetjie beach.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Helloes.</p>
<p>Despite my lack of blogifying here, Roxy has continued to grow!<br />
She&#8217;s five months old now, so mostly fully grown.<br />
Squeak!<br />
Busy times recently with visitors from overseas and work being mentalcrazybusy.</p>
<h3>Class of Puppies</h3>
<p>We graduated from the puppy class (got a certificate and everything. It lives on the fridge. Can&#8217;t wait until she starts bringing drawings home from school!*) and will definitely be joining an intermediate class in the new year. Lots of people are on holidays and things over December, so running classes go a bit quiet because of likely low attendance.</p>
<p>Not sure yet if we&#8217;ll go back to the same place. The beginner class was good, and the location and time (Newlands, Saturday afternoon) are very convenient. I think my only bad comment about the classes is that there was a little too much downtime / playtime compared to learning stuff time. I think I would have preferred more, shorter, breaks and more focused learning bits. But, perhaps that&#8217;s more appropriate for the next class &#8211; we shall see! It was great for socialisation and doing &#8220;tricks&#8221; in &#8220;challenging&#8221; &#8220;situations.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Dog Park</h3>
<p>We have a fairly regular morning routine now: off to The Dog Park after coffee (and training (which continues, btw, at breakfast and dinner)) for some running around and playing with other doggies.<br />
There&#8217;s a pretty solid group that we see every day or so &#8211; one dog and his owner in particular seem to match our timeslot well: Rose and her dog Jack.<br />
Jack is very similar in look and heritage (i.e. mushed) to Roxy, and they get on very well and run around like two mad things being mad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a water spot in The Dog Park (that looks like a municipality water access point) that has a tap in so that folk can fill it up.<br />
Roxy has learned from two Jack Russells that we often see in the park the tricks of: 1 &#8211; spitting the ball into the pool; 2 &#8211; diving into it head (and legs) first.</p>
<p>Exhibits A and B below: evidence and aftermath. [Click to MoreBigIfy]<br />

<h3>&#8220;Cute!&#8221;</h3>
<p>Roxy is still making us even more walky than we were before. I like naytcha.<br />
Most Saturday mornings we go off to Newlands for walkies, sometimes off to further afield.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very pleasing that we still get lots of people saying nice things about Roxy: how pretty and good-natured she is.<br />
I like to think that at least some of this is due to us :).</p>
<h3>Tricksy, Precious</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re about to dig out the books and start looking for new stuff to teach her, but latest greatest hits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump (straight up in the air, not onto a human)</li>
<li>Bark (very exciting, apparently)</li>
<li>Hop (on to tree stumps and rocks when out and about. She may have a complex about being short ;] )</li>
<li>Fetch (loves it. Runs like a mad thing)</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Comments</h3>
<p>*salute*<br />
She&#8217;s still pretty well behaved.<br />
House training seems to have caught on and stuck, even when&#8217;s left in the bedroom and not inside her kennel. Next step for later is to let her have the whole house. For now, for our stuff&#8217;s safety and the cats&#8217; sanity, she stay in our room.<br />
She comes when called, even when in the park or the forest.<br />
She does respond to commands from other people, even&#8230; children.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s still a little bit of a handful in some social situations.<br />
She&#8217;s still young, so she&#8217;s a bit unpredictable.<br />
Went to a braai out at Hendrick&#8217;s the other day, and Roxy decided that barking at kids was Where It&#8217;s At.<br />
Cue much throwing of ball as distraction.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.<br />
Be excellent to each other.</p>
