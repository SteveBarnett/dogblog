				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Roxy Socialisation Program continues apace.<br />
We took her to a (more people than expected) braai yesterday, and she had a great time. Lots of running around and interacting with people and small people and cats (ahem).<br />
She also enjoyed licking the braai grid (<em>after</em> use!) and drinking dirty sink water. As one does.</p>
<p>Her next set of injections are due in two weeks, then we can take her to The Outside World.<br />
I think she is going to Love It.<br />
Walkies will wock the casbah.<br />
<img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>She seems to mostly have stopped chowing jeans. Or at least can be distracted / stopped with a &#8220;Sit.&#8221;<br />
She&#8217;s still chasing the cats a bit (them running away = want to play in Roxy language), but she responds well to a &#8220;Sit!&#8221; even when faced with catversity (catversary?).<br />
There are very few &#8220;accidents&#8221; in the house now. Instead she goes to the back door and sits there. And sometimes mews a little.</p>
<p>Current command list (all currently work without opening a terminal window or prefixing each one with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo">sudo</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Come</li>
<li>Sit</li>
<li>Stay</li>
<li>Down</li>
<li>Leave it</li>
<li>Drop it</li>
<li>(Go to) bed / house (kennel)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re pretty much still doing hand signals for all of them, but are using words for Come, Sit, Stay, Down along with then hands.<br />
Is fun!<br />
Roxy clever!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roxy favourite thing to do (when she&#8217;s excited) is to bite stuff.<br />
Like our toes. Mine are especially easy targets because I&#8217;m wearing slops more often that not.<br />
The <strong>distraction</strong> technique is partially working.<br />
The <strong>yelp</strong> technique seems to be having a better effect. This is the rather embarrassing act of basically imitating a puppy playmate; if Roxy bites too hard, you yelp like you&#8217;ve been hurt (not too difficult &#8211; her teeth are pretty sharp.).<br />
Next step is combining this with downtime. The trick (apparently, like most of the training) is not too make the punishment too shouty / angry. Going to the chill out room (classical music playing almost 24-7. Yo.) isn&#8217;t the punishment (because the chill out room is gooood and *hypno-face* you waaaaant to gooooo there) &#8211; being alone is the punishment. If you are good, you get to spend time with the humans.<br />
Well, something like that.</p>
<p>Going back to the <a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/2010/08/some-special-on-your-own-time/#comment-5">SOHO</a> for a minute: I don&#8217;t have any problems with being a hard ass. Umm&#8230;<br />
I <em>will not</em> go and comfort / say hi to Roxy while she&#8217;s still whining and whinging (and fecking A, she can whine and whinge. The sounds are so weird. I will attempt to describe them later.) when she&#8217;s on her own in the bedroom (and supposed to be sleeping / chilling).<br />
I know that this is good for Roxy (and us) in terms of obedience and a good relationship and all that. But man, it frazzles your head. (0_o)</p>
