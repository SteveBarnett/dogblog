<p>Roxy!</p>
<p>So, following on from our &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to Pinelands&#8221; thing, we, um, didn&#8217;t. Well, we did. But then we didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>We did the flyball there for a while, dipping out after a few weeks. The trainer was lovely, but the other handlers kind of put us off. We looked at them and thought: you&#8217;re taking this a little bit too seriously, you know that? And we were worried we would become like them. And, to be honest, we weren&#8217;t interested in doing the competition stuff, and it&#8217;s all kind of geared towards that/</p>
<p>While were Balling (yo) we spied on the classes. Despite my &#8220;needs structure&#8221; light complaints before, this pushed it a bit too far. The trainers were shouting at the handlers. It was like watching a drill sergeant and the new recruits. It didn&#8217;t look fun for the humans or the dogs. So we decided it was not for us.</p>
<p>A few days after that, I got an SMS from the lovely Newlands lady asking if we&#8217;d be interested in more classes. We said hell yes! The vibe is so much nicer. We go to have fun and learn stuff, and we do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night I went on a photo mission for a certain <a href="http://thegoodstuffproject.wordpress.com/">food blog</a>. Roxy tried to help, thusly:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We went to check out the <a href="http://capeprovincedogclub.co.za/">Pinelands dog school</a> yesterday. Wow, that place is jumping! It was quite a sight to come around the corner to a big school field with a few dozen dogs and handlers. There were a couple of classes running, plus agility stuff going on.<br />
To be honest, it was quite intimidating! It looked so professional and regimented and we felt a bit like yokels bringing our special home school kid: &#8220;Yes&#8217;m, we done trained her to lick Betsy the cow. She do it goooood!&#8221;<br />
The staff / trainers / teachers were absolutely lovely though, and we immediately felt welcome (and they said nice things about Roxy, which always helps!). They were interested and informed, and when the next run of classes start near the end of July we will definitely be there with Roxy to do some &#8220;proper&#8221; training.<br />
Our previous classes in Newlands were great, but not quite as structured as I wanted. At the moment, it feels like this new place is swinging a lot in the other direction, but it feels good. More obedience / discipline is a good thing. For us as well as Roxy!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-259 alignright" title="photo (1)" src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/photo-1-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to start up training things again, but we have a little catching up to do. Heeling requires some work, and we&#8217;re going to start doing clicker training. We bought a clicker from the club shop (which has all types of awesome stuff), and it came with the Best Packaging Ever:</p>
<p>No, your eyes do not deceive you: cat in tiara; dog with bow tie; parrot in tux. I don&#8217;t think there could be more Winning that this. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we just finished our intermediate puppy class thingy, which was great fun.<br />
Not so much with the New Stuff Learning, but great socialising and practising.<br />
Seems like we need to wait a few months before we can do the flyballing and stuff with the RoxBox, but we want to carry on teaching her stuff, and she&#8217;s keen.</p>
<p>So, we are doing <strong>vocab</strong>. Expanding the number of words that she knows.<br />
Verbs To Do: Nose; Paw.<br />
Nouns to do: eeeeeeverything. Well, a bunch of stuff. Each toy needs to have a clearly distinct name.</p>
<p>She seems to like nosing: it is exciting.</p>
<p>Arf!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Roxy seemed to love Shekinah Lodge.<br />
She came home very tired*, a bit scratched**, and very happy.<br />
It took her a minute to come out of the Wendy house and say hello because she was so deep asleep!</p>
<p>She seems to have remembered all the basic level training from &#8220;before,&#8221; but is struggling a bit with the compound command stuff. And this morning she was just mental. &#8220;Run! I wish to Run!&#8221;</p>
<p>We have finally caved in to her demands and have got her a cellphone.<br />
At least now we can check on her via SMS whenever we want.<br />
What? We&#8217;re not mad.<br />
It&#8217;s only a Pay As You Go!<br />
Pffft!***</p>
<p>Roxy is now sleeping through night, mostly.<br />
The problem is that rest of The Zoo sets her off.<br />
Sproing likes to &#8220;Start Some Shit&#8221; or &#8220;Set It Off&#8221; an hour or half an hour before actual waking up time, and tis wakes up Roxy.<br />
She tends to settle down and go back to sleep after a quick trip outside, though.</p>
<p>House training seems to be pretty much sorted. This is partially because we don&#8217;t give her the chance to get it wrong.<br />
When we started getting all these free papers over the wall a while ago, we were happy because we needed them. Now they&#8217;re just mounting up in the cupboard because we&#8217;re not using them.<br />
My spies tell me that some people <em>read</em> newspapers.<br />
I am intrigued by this.</p>
<p>_____<br />
* &#8211; two days. She<br />
basically just slept for two days after she came back. I think she was playing all day long while she was there.<br />
** &#8211; a few minor cuts and scrapes that you&#8217;d expect from all day rough and tumble on a farm with a bunch of other dogs. I don&#8217;t think <em>she</em> even noticed!<br />
***- yes, this paragraph was a &#8220;joke.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>Puppy Class last week went much better.<br />
For the humans <strong>and</strong> Roxy!<br />
She still went crazy-play-time with the other dogs (especially a little Miniature Terrier called Knoffel, who Jo snapped a pic of &#8211; must remember to grab it. They is bestest fwiends), but she did much better in terms of concentration for the training stuff.<br />
It was kewl!<br />
Proud puppy parents, we were :).</p>
<h3>Compound Commands</h3>
<p>By which I mean: Stay, do some stuff, Unstay.<br />
And: Leave it, do some stuff, Unleaveit.<br />
Not so easy! But she&#8217;s getting good at it.</p>
<p>Leave it is still her favourite game.<br />
Favourite variation: Leave It, Down (tentatively), Come (excitedly), OK.</p>
<p>Aside: some of the books recommend praising a good obey with Good + Name of Command.<br />
&#8220;Good Come&#8221; will <em>never</em> get old :).</p>
<h3>TRL #5</h3>
<p>Her bed.<br />
And destroying it.<br />
As of a few minutes ago, there is just a mess of material where once there was a comfy bed.<br />
She hasn&#8217;t (touch wood!) chowed up anything else, though. At all. Is odd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday we did another lovely walk in Newlands forest.<br />
And we unleashed Teh Roxxel! I mean deleashed. I mean took the leash off.<br />
She was very well behaved! So much so that we think she didn&#8217;t realise that the leash was off.<br />
No running away to investigate interesting smells, or that kind of thing. She stuck by us strolling.<br />
It was pleasing! <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>The only, ahem, slight problem was that it went on a bit longer than we planned.<br />
About an hour instead of about half an hour.<br />
This is a little bit a function of our style of Newlands walking (which is: no plan. Just meander).<br />
She was falling asleep in the car on the way home.<br />
Normally this is great, but in an hour or so&#8217;s time was&#8230;</p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve opted, for now, for a class in Newlands.<br />
The one we really wanted to go to is <a href="http://www.tarynblyth.co.za/">Taryn Blyth</a>&#8216;s (she sounds great and has the kind of approach that we concur with), but she&#8217;s out in Kommetjie, and so it&#8217;s not really practical.</p>
<p>Roxy barely woke up for the trip there, but found a new source of energy once we arrived and especially once the other puppies did. (0_0)!<br />
She was a little bit mental for most of the class, and didn&#8217;t do so well on obeying commands and things. She was very excited by all the other dogs.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ve identified more specifically what the problem is. Whenever we take her to see other dogs it&#8217;s playtime. We let the dogs run around while the humans chat. We need to get RoxBox used to the idea that presence of other dogs doesn&#8217;t always equal playtime.<br />
This will be difficult!</p>
<p>The other pups and owners are lovely, and the class leader lady is very nice. I found the class a little frustrating, but this is partially my fault at not speaking up.<br />
The class is teaching things like sit, stay, etc. from scratch, but we&#8217;ve been doing these at home. (A lot! Her breakfast and dinner kibbles are served as rewards for obeying commands. Roxy has the commands down pat inside, away from distraction. She&#8217;s still learning to do these things on walks (pretty good) and in the garden (not so good).)<br />
It seemed that the other owners&#8217; problems were teaching their dog what sit means, whereas ours is teaching Roxy that she must still sit when we say it, even if other dogs are about!</p>
<p>It could very well be the case that the other owners are in the same position as us, and not speaking up for fear of sounding odd / arrogant / boastful. I&#8217;m going to be more pro-active next time and talk to the the teacher about this. How do we get Roxy to chill out a bit and obey when there are lots of other doggies around.</p>

<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0716.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0716-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0716" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-131" /></a><br />
That was the other day. We&#8217;re going for short morning walks every day now.<br />
She&#8217;s a little nervous, but very nose-excited by it all.<br />
Leash training is progressing. She&#8217;s getting good at not pulling.<br />
Observe the cunning belt-leash technique: two hands free!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re more aggressively crating now. As in doing it more.<br />
I like it.<br />
I confess to be jealous of the greeting that Jo gets when she comes home. Roxy is <em>mega</em> excited &#8211; I shall try and get a pic of the tail wagging the dog.<br />
Now, I get that greeting when I let her out of the crate. So nice! <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>She is, alas, chasing the cats more rather than less.<br />
She doesn&#8217;t want to eat them, she just wants to play. The cats do not.</p>
<p>But, all in all, being a puppy daddy is worth the hard work. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
And seeing the kibbles transform into dog is awesome. She is growing fast!</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of Roxy sleeping. We like her sleeping. She is cute and not too mad.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our big challenges / missions at the moment are crate training (going quite well!

She does enjoy walkies. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), and outside training (Umm&#8230; She&#8217;s very well behaved inside, but the outside is very, very, exciting. She gets distracted. So each day we&#8217;re doing some inside training, then some deck training, working up to garden training).</p>
<p>We went for a walk in Newlands Forest today. Without Roxy, alas &#8211; final injections due next week. Dog walking there is going to be awesome! We already enjoy walking there, but going with a doggy (like just about everyone else there) will be extra awesome.</p>
<h3>Pictures!</h3>

<p>And last, but by no means least: the perfect object. No other objects need ever be made again. A rubber chicken (that squawks on squeezing) in a pirate costume (including eyepatch and wooden leg!). ZOMGBBQ! Ahem.<br />

We found it at the Milnerton Flea Market yesterday. Award yourself five bonus points if you guessed that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Roxy Socialisation Program continues apace.<br />
We took her to a (more people than expected) braai yesterday, and she had a great time. Lots of running around and interacting with people and small people and cats (ahem).<br />
She also enjoyed licking the braai grid (<em>after</em> use!) and drinking dirty sink water. As one does.</p>
<p>Her next set of injections are due in two weeks, then we can take her to The Outside World.<br />
I think she is going to Love It.<br />
Walkies will wock the casbah.<br />

<p>She seems to mostly have stopped chowing jeans. Or at least can be distracted / stopped with a &#8220;Sit.&#8221;<br />
She&#8217;s still chasing the cats a bit (them running away = want to play in Roxy language), but she responds well to a &#8220;Sit!&#8221; even when faced with catversity (catversary?).<br />
There are very few &#8220;accidents&#8221; in the house now. Instead she goes to the back door and sits there. And sometimes mews a little.</p>
<p>Current command list (all currently work without opening a terminal window or prefixing each one with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo">sudo</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Come</li>
<li>Sit</li>
<li>Stay</li>
<li>Down</li>
<li>Leave it</li>
<li>Drop it</li>
<li>(Go to) bed / house (kennel)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re pretty much still doing hand signals for all of them, but are using words for Come, Sit, Stay, Down along with then hands.<br />
Is fun!<br />
Roxy clever!<br />
