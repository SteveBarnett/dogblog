				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re doing pretty regular walkies in Newlands now.<br />
Catch us LIVE early Saturday mornings!<br />
Ahem.<br />
Here&#8217;s a pic of Roxy being unsure of forest stream stuff:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3089.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3089-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3089" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-164" /></a></p>
<p>Apologies for the general recent lack of photos.<br />
She&#8217;s pretty active, and here are representative samples of what lots of the pictures on camera look like:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3092.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3092-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3092" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-165" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3094.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3094-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3094" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-166" /></a><br />
<img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Touch of Class</h3>
<p>Puppy class was cancelled yesterday since most people are off on holiday for the long weekend.<br />
We are okay with that.<br />
Ahem.</p>
<h3>TRL #4</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a new treat was tried: a boiled egg.<br />
She lurved it.<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3139.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3139-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3139" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-167" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3144.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3144-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3144" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-168" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3154.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3154-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3154" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-169" /></a></p>
<h3>Ear Watch</h3>
<p>Still some good oneuponedownmanship:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3169.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF3169-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF3169" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-170" /></a><br />
There&#8217;s a slight general leaning to left on both, like she&#8217;s standing in front a wind turbine.</p>
<h3>It moves in mysterious ways</h3>
<p>Up until now, the kennel had been next to the bed.<br />
As a sort of security blanket kind of thing.<br />
Yesterday we moved it into the corner of the room and threw in some treats (biltong and stuff) to ease the transition.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure she noticed.<br />
<img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h3>Leave It</h3>
<p>One &#8220;trick&#8221; that she&#8217;s pretty good at it is <strong>Leave It</strong>.<br />
Immediately after she learnt it, and we started putting it on the ground, she would jump back a little. Like she had to back up a bit so she wouldn&#8217;t be tempted.<br />
Now she stays still, and we can walk around the house, and she&#8217;ll leave it.</p>
<p>The reason I mention it is because we&#8217;re being sneaky and using it to help other stuff.<br />
She doesn&#8217;t like eating from her bowl.<br />
Every morning and evening we train her with her food, and when she seems to have reached her limit for the day, we put the rest in the bowl.<br />
She would look at it slightly confused / disturbed, and trot off. If we put it on the floor, next to the bowl, she would hoover it up.<br />
So, new plan, working so far, is to put the bowl down and tell her to Leave It. Then when you release her with &#8220;OK&#8221; she trots up to the bowl and commences noshing.<br />
Huzzah!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday we did another lovely walk in Newlands forest.<br />
And we unleashed Teh Roxxel! I mean deleashed. I mean took the leash off.<br />
She was very well behaved! So much so that we think she didn&#8217;t realise that the leash was off.<br />
No running away to investigate interesting smells, or that kind of thing. She stuck by us strolling.<br />
It was pleasing! <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>The only, ahem, slight problem was that it went on a bit longer than we planned.<br />
About an hour instead of about half an hour.<br />
This is a little bit a function of our style of Newlands walking (which is: no plan. Just meander).<br />
She was falling asleep in the car on the way home.<br />
Normally this is great, but in an hour or so&#8217;s time was&#8230;</p>
<h3>Puppy Class</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve opted, for now, for a class in Newlands.<br />
The one we really wanted to go to is <a href="http://www.tarynblyth.co.za/">Taryn Blyth</a>&#8216;s (she sounds great and has the kind of approach that we concur with), but she&#8217;s out in Kommetjie, and so it&#8217;s not really practical.</p>
<p>Roxy barely woke up for the trip there, but found a new source of energy once we arrived and especially once the other puppies did. (0_0)!<br />
She was a little bit mental for most of the class, and didn&#8217;t do so well on obeying commands and things. She was very excited by all the other dogs.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ve identified more specifically what the problem is. Whenever we take her to see other dogs it&#8217;s playtime. We let the dogs run around while the humans chat. We need to get RoxBox used to the idea that presence of other dogs doesn&#8217;t always equal playtime.<br />
This will be difficult!</p>
<p>The other pups and owners are lovely, and the class leader lady is very nice. I found the class a little frustrating, but this is partially my fault at not speaking up.<br />
The class is teaching things like sit, stay, etc. from scratch, but we&#8217;ve been doing these at home. (A lot! Her breakfast and dinner kibbles are served as rewards for obeying commands. Roxy has the commands down pat inside, away from distraction. She&#8217;s still learning to do these things on walks (pretty good) and in the garden (not so good).)<br />
It seemed that the other owners&#8217; problems were teaching their dog what sit means, whereas ours is teaching Roxy that she must still sit when we say it, even if other dogs are about!</p>
<p>It could very well be the case that the other owners are in the same position as us, and not speaking up for fear of sounding odd / arrogant / boastful. I&#8217;m going to be more pro-active next time and talk to the the teacher about this. How do we get Roxy to chill out a bit and obey when there are lots of other doggies around.</p>

A land of&#8230; land. And Newness.<br />
And a forest where people like to walk their doggies a lot.<br />
Now including us!<br />

<small>I will make a terrible, boastful, human-parent&#8230;</small></p>
<h3>TRL #2: Teh Ball</h3>
<p><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0752.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0752-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0752" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-142" /></a><a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0750.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0750-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0750" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-141" /></a></p>
<h3>Weight watch</h3>
<p>She has slightly more than doubled in size since we got her.<br />
Crikey!</p>
<h3>&#8220;Oh, behave!&#8221;</h3>
<p>The terrible twos, as they call it for humans, are on us.<br />
She&#8217;s starting to be naughty and misbehave a bit.<br />
On the other hand, we took her to House of Lawful Good &#038; Evil last night for our traditional Sunday shenanigans, and Jo and I did a full training session with her in the house. Yay!<br />
And, once we got her an old towel to sleep on, she collapsed asleep for a few hours. Yay!</p>
<h3>In other news&#8230;</h3>
<p>She has an awesome new collar:<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0758.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0758-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0758" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-143" /></a><br />
Just in time for Talk Like A Pirate Day!</p>
<h3>Canine / Feline relations section</h3>
<p>Fair, but must try harder.<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0746.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0746-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0746" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-140" /></a><br />
Both cats are standing up to Roxy more (which good because she&#8217;s about to outsize them). The don&#8217;t run way much &#8211; they sit and stare and punch as necessary.</p>
<h3>Sleeping</h3>
<p>Um, not so good. For me. Quite tired.<br />
At the moment we&#8217;re getting up in the middle of the night, then again at about 6.<br />
Roxy&#8217;s quite good at crawling back into her bed, though. We get up at 6.30, but she&#8217;s happy to snooze that little section between 6ish and 6.30(ish!).</p>
<h3>Last but not least: picture rush!</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walkies!<br />
<a href="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0716.jpg"><img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSCF0716-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF0716" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-131" /></a><br />
That was the other day. We&#8217;re going for short morning walks every day now.<br />
She&#8217;s a little nervous, but very nose-excited by it all.<br />
Leash training is progressing. She&#8217;s getting good at not pulling.<br />
Observe the cunning belt-leash technique: two hands free!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re more aggressively crating now. As in doing it more.<br />
I like it.<br />
I confess to be jealous of the greeting that Jo gets when she comes home. Roxy is <em>mega</em> excited &#8211; I shall try and get a pic of the tail wagging the dog.<br />
Now, I get that greeting when I let her out of the crate. So nice! <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>She is, alas, chasing the cats more rather than less.<br />
She doesn&#8217;t want to eat them, she just wants to play. The cats do not.</p>
<p>But, all in all, being a puppy daddy is worth the hard work. <img src="http://dogblog.comovedy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
And seeing the kibbles transform into dog is awesome. She is growing fast!</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of Roxy sleeping. We like her sleeping. She is cute and not too mad.<br />
